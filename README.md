# Why this script?
Well that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it.
I sometimes work on a multi-repositories project. So I like to know what I changed on all repos.

Once installed, you can go to the main directory (not a git one) then type `git-status` and it'll tell you everything.


# Install

* Create the file on the directory of your choice
* Type (on a terminal): `$ chmod +x git-status`
* Then type: `$ mv git-status /usr/local/bin/git-status` to have it available
